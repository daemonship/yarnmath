## What It Solves

Knitters struggle to visualize how a finished pattern will look with their chosen yarn and to accurately calculate how much yarn they need, leading to wasted money and materials.

## Who It's For

Hand-knitters and crocheters who follow digital patterns, especially those substituting yarns.

## Features

- **Yardage calculator** — enter your pattern's required yardage and the yardage per skein of your substitute yarn; get back how many skeins you need, total yardage, and cost estimate
- **Gauge adjustment** — compensate for gauge differences between the pattern yarn and your substitute
- **Unit conversion** — work in yards or meters
- **Cross-weight warning** — alerts you when substituting across more than one CYC weight category
- **Yarn weight reference** — built-in modal with CYC weight descriptions and typical gauge ranges

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with Vite
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vitest** + Testing Library for unit and component tests
- **Playwright** for end-to-end tests
- **Plausible** for privacy-first analytics (no cookies, no GDPR banner needed)

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run end-to-end tests (requires running dev server)
npm run e2e

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required. The app is fully static — all logic runs in the browser.

The Plausible analytics snippet in `index.html` is hardcoded to the production domain (`yarnmath.fly.dev`). For local development this is harmless; Plausible simply won't track localhost traffic.

## Deploy

The app builds to a static `dist/` folder and can be deployed anywhere that serves static files.

### Fly.io

```bash
# First-time setup (requires flyctl installed and logged in)
fly launch

# Deploy
fly deploy
```

The app uses Vite's static build — no server-side runtime required. On Fly.io configure the app to serve the `dist/` folder (e.g. via nginx or a lightweight static file server).

### Other hosts

Any static host works: Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages. Point the host at the `dist/` directory after running `npm run build`.
